This project explores the fusion of hand gesture recognition and FPV (First-Person View) to create an immersive racing experience. Using an MPU6050 IMU sensor, we implemented intuitive motion control, allowing users to steer the race car with simple hand movements. A first-person camera mounted on the car streams live footage to a headset, enhancing the driving experience.
